                        This project was started with the help of two very good
                        friends of mine. For context, NixOS (no relation to me) is a free and open-source
                        Linux distribution known for its reproducibility and portability.
                        This is achieved by using immutable design, and an atomic update model.
                        The distribution uses the Nix language, which is used in packages
                        recipes and configurations. The language itself is functional, meaning
                        that each nix file is a function, that can be imported for use in other
                        such files <sup><a href="https://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf">[1]</a></sup>.
                        For more information, feel free to check out my repository 
                        <a href="https://github.com/gnix22/NixOSConfig" class="card-link">here</a>.

                    In the both the summer of 2024 and 2025, I had the wonderful opporunity to be a research assistant 
                    at Winthrop University in the SURE program. I worked on statistical theory, in specific I worked with
                    generalizing the continuous Bernoulli distribution. The research was a lot of fun and I learned many 
                    things in regard to mathematics, as well as how to manage time in the best way that I could. If you 
                    are interested in seeing at least some of the code, I have created a repository that contains some files
                    that were used during the <a href="https://github.com/gnix22/Summer_Research_2024" class="card-link">research</a>.

                    This project marks my first CLI program I've ever created. The functionality is minimal at the moment
                    as it was just something I created to be used for budget tracking. I plan to eventually add some
                    statistical inference elements to the program to add more predictive capabilities in the long run. This
                    project is still very much a work in progress, thus I don't have link yet, but it will be added when the 
                    repository is made public.
